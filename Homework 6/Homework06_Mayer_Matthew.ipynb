The cost of the floating-point operations can usually be determined analytically, but the cost of memory access can be harder to determine. The memory access cost depends on the amount of data used, the order in which the data is accessed, and the structure of the computer itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory hierarchy of a typical cache-based computer includes, in order of increasing size and distance from the CPU: the registers, the caches, the main memory, and the disk. The time reequiired to access data from these components increases dramatically with distance from the CPU. For example, the access of a small amount of data from the cache may take as little as one clock cycle to complete, while the same access from main memory can take tens of clock cycles. (A clock cycle on a modern processor is typically on the order of a few nanoseconds.) The time to access the disk can be substantially longer, with access times growing into seconds or minutes in extreme cases. The access times grow proportionally as the amount of data increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good numerical program is thus structured to avoid disk access as much as possible, both by reducing the amount of data used and by organizing its access to make the best use of memory hierarchy. Best performance is achieved by programs that also move little data in and out of main memory. In this part of the problem, we'll study how to organize some matrix computations to minimize the amount of distant memory accessed by minimizing the amount of data moved.\n",
